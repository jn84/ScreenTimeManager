----Managing rules----
    Rule types:
        A class or set of classes/interfaces for handling the various
        rule types. (Fixed time rule, Variable time rule, or any future types)

        Contains methods to calculate time (interface?)

        -- These are static/hard coded types. No need to store in the database

    Rules:
        Task specific rules that will determine how much time is added/subtracted
        based on fixed/variable input. This class will be passed to the "rule applicator"
        who will handle adding

        Potential data members:
            A rule type: So that the processor (rule applicator) can see what type of rule
            to use to calculate the time added/subtracted

----Managing Time----
    "Rule applicator" (for lack of a better term)
        -- This is chosen to be housed in the model so that it can be used by other future
           implementations in the same way as the web application
         - A class that will calculate the time earned/lost time then apply that information in the necessary places.
           This includes saving to the history

    Rule History/Time History:
        - Every time a rule is applied, or the timer stopped/started, the relevant information should be applied to the database
        -
